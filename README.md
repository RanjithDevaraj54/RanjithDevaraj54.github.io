:pushpin:This is my first game created using unity

:pushpin:All the objects in the game are modelled and the pattern was designed using Blender

:pushpin:The game contains :three: Level

:o: Level :one: Would be probably easy by avoiding obstacles and collecting the rewards

:o: Level :two: will be little tough by avoiding obstacles and collecting the rewards

:o: Level :three: is made as a infinite game where you have to avoid the obstacle and collect the rewards just like the previous levels

:o: For level :one: and :two: use **W-A-D keys** to move cube in front,left and right direction

:o: For the level :three: the game is designed in a 2-D Format where you can use** **SPACE KEY** to jump and avoid obstacles

:o: In first two levels the round will be automatically restarts when you failed 

:o:In the Last level use must press **R-KEY** to restart the game
