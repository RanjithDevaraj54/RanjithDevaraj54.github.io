:pushpin:This is my first game created using unity
:pushpin:All the objects in the game are modelled and the pattern was designed using Blender
:pushpin:The game contains :three: Level
:o:First level :one: Would be probably easy by avoiding obstacles and collecting the rewards
:o:Second level :two: will be little tough by avoiding obstacles and collecting the rewards
:o:Third Level :three: is made as a infinite game where you have to avoid the obstacle and collect the rewards just like the previous levels
:o:For First and second leave use **W-A-D keys** to move cube in front,left and right direction
:o:For the final level the game is designed in a 2-D Format where you can use** **SPACE KEY** to jump and avoid obstacles
:o:In first two levels the round will be automatically restarts when you failed 
:o:In the Last level use must press **R-KEY** to restart the game 
You can play the game in the https://ranjithdevaraj54.github.io/ which is hosted by me in the github environment
